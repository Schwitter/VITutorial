    "# How to implement a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)\n",
    "\n",
    "A variational autoencoder observes data, infers a latent code for it and tries to reconstruct the data from that latent code. In contrast to regular autoencoders, the code of the VAE is **random**. That means that when presented with the same input, the VAE will produce a slightly different code each time. This makes its decoding process more robust, since it has to deal with noisy code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of looking at a VAE is as a training procedure for a probablistic model. The model is \n",
    "$$p(x) = \\int p(z)p(x|z) dz$$\n",
    "where $z$ is the latent code and $x$ is the data. During training we need to infer a posterior over $z$. In the case of a VAE this is done by neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that the theory of VAEs has already been presented, we now dive straight into implementing them. If you need more background on VAEs, have a look at our [tutorial slides](https://github.com/philschulz/VITutorial/tree/master/modules) and the references therein."

During inference, we use a multivariate Gaussian variational distribution with diagonal covariance matrix. This means that we are only modelling variance but not covariance (in fact, a k-dimensional Guassian with diagonal covariance has the same density as a product of k independent univariate Gaussians). Geometrically, this variational distribution can only account for spherical but not for elliptical densities. It is thus rather limited in its modelling capabilities. Still, because it uses a neural network under the hood, it is very expressive. \n",

Besides tracking the ELBO, which is our optimisation objective, we can also track to KL divergence to see how far the variational approximation moves away from the prior."

    "Up to now we have made a mean field assumption, meaning that all dimensions of our latent variable were uncorrelated. This is a very limiting (and unrealistic) assumption, of course. In the following, we are going to fully correlate the dimensions of our latent variable. We achieve this by replacing the vector of standard deviations with a lower-triangular matrix known as a [cholesky factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesky_decomposition). This matrix is unconstrained and can thus be computed from a simple feed-forward layer (here we chose a one-hidden-layer net to introduce some non-linearity). Below is some code that will compute that matrix for you."

You will also need to replace the KL-term in Gaussian VAE. The KL for the full-covariance multivariate Gaussian is given below (we again assume a standard normal prior).
