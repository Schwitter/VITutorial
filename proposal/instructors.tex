I am a research associate at the University of Amsterdam working on natural language processing problems such as machine translation, word alignment, textual entailment, and paraphrasing. My interests sit at the intersection of disciplines such as formal languages, machine learning, approximate inference, global optimisation, and computational linguistics.
Recently, I've developed quite an interest in Bayesian deep learning. In particular, I'm developing probabilistic neural network models that reason with and induce forms of discrete generalisation such as trees and graphs.

I am interested in Bayesian graphical modelling, deep generative models, and approximate inference methods. Currently I am working on hierarchical Bayesian models for machine translation and in particular word alignment. These models require efficient inference algorithms such as MCMC sampling and variational inference. Together with Wilker I have designed a fast Gibbs sampler for our word alignment model. More recently, I have started to work with variational inference and stochastic gradients.
