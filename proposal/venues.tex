\section{Venues}

The preferred venue for this tutorial is ACL 2018. The reason is that we expect an audience with
a strong technical background and a keen interest in new machine learning techniques at this conference.
EMNLP 2018 would also be possible for the same reasons. However, we reckon that we can reach a larger
audience and thus better disseminate these new thechniques at ACL. In particular, ACL attracts 
a more balanced mix of technical and non-technical audiences and thus gives us the chance to relate
Deep Generative Models to researchers who may not even be aware of them.

NAACL and Coling are dispreferred options since the former is regional and the latter has a strong
focus on linguistic insights. While we do believe that Deep Generative models can enable and
enhance linguistic investigation of language data, we are not sure that the audience at 
Coling would feel attracted to a machine-learning-focused tutorial like ours.
